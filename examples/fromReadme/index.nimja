{% extends partials/_master.nimja%}
{#
  extends uses the master.nimja template as the "base".
  All the `block`s that are defined in the master.nimja are filled
  with blocks from this template.

  If the templates extends another, all content HAVE TO be in a block.

  blocks can have arbitrary names

  currently the extends must be on the FIRST LINE!
#}


{% block content %}
  {# A random loop to show off. #}
  {# Data is defined here for demo purpose, but could come frome database etc.. #}

{% block footer %}
  {#
    we can call arbitraty nim code in the templates.
    Here we pick a random user from users.
  #}
  {% var user = users.sample() %}

  {#
    imported templates have access to all variables declared in the parent.
    So `user` is usable in "./partials/user.nimja"
  #}
  This INDEX was presented by.... {% importnimja "./partials/_user.nimja" %}
{% endblock footer %} {# the 'footer' in endblock is completely optional #}
